Gen AI Chatbot Projects – Internship Portfolio

This repository contains 6 Generative AI-based Chatbot projects developed during my internship. Each project explores different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Conversational AI.

Overview

The goal of these projects was to design, build, and deploy intelligent chatbots that can understand, process, and respond to user queries in natural language. These bots integrate modern AI techniques like:

Text Classification & Intent Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Sentiment Analysis & Context-Aware Conversations

Domain-Specific Knowledge Chatbots

Deployment with Streamlit / Flask / APIs

Projects Included

Customer Support Chatbot – Assists users with FAQs and support queries.

Healthcare Q&A Bot – Provides medical-related answers using curated datasets.

Sales & Product Recommendation Bot – Suggests products based on user needs.

Document Retrieval RAG Chatbot – Answers queries from PDFs and text corpora.

Sentiment-Aware Chatbot – Responds empathetically by detecting user sentiment.

Multilingual Chatbot – Handles conversations in multiple languages.
